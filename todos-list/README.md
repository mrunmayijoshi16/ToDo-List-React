# 📝 ToDo List App

This is a simple and modern ToDo List application built using **React**. It allows users to add, view, and delete their daily tasks, with persistent storage using the browser's localStorage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
